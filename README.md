## 🎯 Objectives
Consolidate knowledge on:
- A typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results
- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on the results of the AJAX requests
- Learn to aggregate and parse data fetched from an API

## ✔️Specifications
### 🌱 Must-haves
- Create an account on [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/.), and generate a key
- Get the weather data using the native JS [`fetch()`](https://devdocs.io/dom/fetch_api/using_fetch) method (if you like, you can also check out [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios))
- In the home page the user can enter the city of his/her choice (think of the right HTML elements here)
- On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 5 days
- The application must be responsive and mobile friendly

### 🌻 Nice-to-haves
- Display a line graph of temperature over time using a library such as [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org)
- Remember the user choice on subsequent visits
- Allow the user to compare the weather in two cities
- Use the API of https://unsplash.com/ to show a photo of the city they entered in the form.
